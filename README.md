# STEM Upgrade Phase 3

**Project Description:**

The STEM Upgrade Project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at enhancing the user experience of our software by modernising its graphical user interface (GUI) while retaining the core functionality that interacts seamlessly with an SQL backend. Our primary goal is to deliver a cleaner, more responsive, and user-friendly interface.

**Project Components:**

**1. Front-End Transformation:**

The project centers around transforming the front-end of our software, known as "STEM", which is currently Java-based. The upgraded GUI will offer users an intuitive and visually appealing interface, making it easier to interact with our software.

The project design will revamp the existing user interface elements, such as menus, forms, and navigation, to provide a smoother and more efficient user experience.

By incorporating modern design principles, we will improve the software's overall look and feel, enhancing user satisfaction and productivity.

**2. Enhanced Functionality:**

The upgraded STEM software will retain its key features, including the ability to issue licenses, modify license periods, block users, and assign applications to individual users for a single package. These essential operations will be seamlessly integrated into the new interface.

The software will have the capability to issue licenses with a streamlined and user-friendly form that guides them through the process efficiently.

**3. Database Interaction:**

To support these operations, the software will continue to rely on an SQL backend, utilising MySQL as the underlying database management system. The database tables dedicated to license management and user access will be optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval.

The software's interaction with the MySQL database will be designed for seamless data synchronization, providing real-time updates to users. It will fine-tune the database schema to improve performance and ensure data integrity when handling license issuance and management.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A modern and responsive GUI that enhances user satisfaction and usability.
- Improved user engagement and efficiency when performing license-related operations.
- Continued reliability and stability by leveraging MySQL as the backend database system.
- A software upgrade that aligns with the evolving needs and expectations of our user base.

The STEM Upgrade Project is committed to delivering a more polished, user-centric software experience.
